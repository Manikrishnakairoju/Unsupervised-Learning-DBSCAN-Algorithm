# Unsupervised-Learning-DBSCAN-Algorithm
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm used for clustering data,clusters are dense regions of data points separated by areas of lower density.DBSCAN does not require a predefined number of clusters,can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes. Identifies outliers, labeling them as "noise."
