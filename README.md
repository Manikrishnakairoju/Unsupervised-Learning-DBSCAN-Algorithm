# Unsupervised-Learning-DBSCAN-Algorithm
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm used for clustering data,clusters are dense regions of data points separated by areas of lower density.DBSCAN does not require a predefined number of clusters,can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes. Identifies outliers, labeling them as "noise." 
Objective
The objective of this  is to familiarize  with popular clustering techniques by building models. 
Understand the mathematics behind clustering algorithms
Learn important distance measures
Learn to identify which algorithm to apply where.
Identify the parameters of common clustering techniques.
Dataset: the Iris Dataset from Kaggle.
